♥ Base V1.4.4 ♥ 
===============

Base is a front-end HTML5 template. Featuring the latest technologies and impeccable code this download is the ideal starting point for any web project.


Features
--------

Base is a CSS/SASS/HTML5 based mobile first front end template which is impeccably neat and tidy and is an ideal starting point for a web project of any size.

Base is for developers who want a platform to start their web projects. Base offers the fundamental parts of a web project that a developer can then build upon.

Base is extremely lightweight and is ready to go straight out of the box. Download the files. Choose either CSS/SASS for your stylesheet language and then get coding. The files are impeccably neat and generously commented and they include markup and style examples.

Base uses a mobile first/progressive enhancement approach. It offers some basic features such as media queries, but it’s also very modular so if you don’t want something then take it out. Chances are you will use everything that’s in there though.

Base is not an extensive template that offers a ton of code that means a developer doesn’t have to do much coding. Only an amateurish developer would use those. ;-)

Grunt
--------

Grunt is a task runner that can dramatically improve your front-end development workflow. With the use of a number of grunt plugins you can automate tasks such as compiling SASS and CoffeeScript, optimizing images and validating your JavaScript code with JSHint.

To find out more regardless of whether you are using Grunt or not then have a read of the following post.

REMEMBER you don't have to use Grunt or SASS, read the post above for more info.


SASS Modules
-------------

The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS. Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables.

- _variables.scss - Colours, Gradients, Typography
- _functions.scss - All the functions go in here
- _mixins.scss - All the mixins go in here
- _vendor.scss - The vendor directory is for third-party CSS


SASS Partials
-------------

The partials directory is where most of the CSS is constructed. Plan ahead and think how to structure these.

- _reset.scss - Reset, including HTML5
- _base.scss - All the base elements, HTML, body, container, headers, links, img, blockquote etc
- _buttons.scss - Button styles
- _forms.scss - Form styles
- _font-face.scss - Font face stuff


Structuring your projects
-------------

This is a developer preference. There is no offical way.
Do you want all your pages in partials?
Would you rather just add main components and still use style.scss for the bulk of the CSS?
Do what's best for you and your project.
