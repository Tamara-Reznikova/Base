The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS. Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables.

- _variables.scss - Colours, Gradients, Typography.
- _functions.scss - All the functions go in here
- _mixins.scss - All the mixins go in here

The partials directory is where most of the CSS is constructed. Plan ahead and think how to structure your partials.

- _reset.scss - Reset, including HTML5
- _base.scss - All the base elements, HTML, body, container, headers, links, img, blockquote etc
- _buttons.scss - Button styles
